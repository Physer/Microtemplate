# Microtemplate

A Visual Studio solution template for microservices in .NET/C#

## Introduction

This is a multi-project solution template for Visual Studio to quickly scaffold a microservice based on [Clean Architecture](https://jasontaylor.dev/clean-architecture-getting-started/).

You can add this template to your Visual Studio templates and use it as a starting point for creating a new Microservice without repeating yourself.

## How to use

1. Download the latest `Microtemplate.zip` file from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Physer/Microtemplate/releases)
2. Place the ZIP file in your Visual Studio user data location: `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Visual Studio 2022\Templates` 
3. If Visual Studio was open, restart it
4. You can now create a new project using the `Microtemplate` project template
